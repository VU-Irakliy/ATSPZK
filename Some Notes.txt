Some Notes on how to use the tree library


Node() a tree node that has to have a name
AnyNode() tree node with no name
Node(name, parent = , weight = )
.weight - shows the weight of the B node if reached from A node
.children - we see the nodes children in a form of a tuple 

w = Walker() creates a walker
It helps us traverse the tree
w.walk(A,B) They have to be a part of the same tree


Assignment Problem:
Worst case scenario for formed subtoures: If N is even -> n/2 and if N is odd -> n/2 - 0.5
